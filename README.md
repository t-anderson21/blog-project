This repository contains code for retrieving and analyzing economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database using Python. The code utilizes the fredapi package to access various economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, inflation rate, housing prices, and more.

I will be working on a StreamLit interface app for a final project.
